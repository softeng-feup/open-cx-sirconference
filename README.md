# Vision

Our vision is simple: we want to revolutionise the way conferences are carried out. Ultimately, we are aiming towards a new "conference style", in which participants have a bigger role than ever. In our view, conferences should no longer be about big talks and just hearing.

By accomplishing this mission, we are making such events way more interesting for everyone. Presenters will experience a greater involvement from their audience, and the latter will not have any reasons not to actively participate on the conference. Everyone will be able to share their thoughts/concerns in the way they deem more comfortable for themselves, including anonymously.

If we had just to list some characteristics we value, those would surely be in the list:
 - Safistied users;
 - Contribution to community;
 - Product quality;
 - Simple, yet functional.
 
To make it more clear, we intend to implement a solution that is going to serve the most two important cores of any conference: speakers and audience. For more information on how both will benefit from our implementation, please refer to the user stories section.

# Requirements

This section will be used to specify the functionalities of our final product through many different ways, thus being split into the topics below.
By analyzing the problem from several perspectives, giving a special attention to the user's, we expect to build a strong outline of what our project will consist of and which problems it is going to address.
