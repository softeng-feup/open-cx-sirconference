# Vision

Our vision is simple: we want to revolutionise the way conferences are carried out. Ultimately, wee are aiming towards a new "conference style", in which participants have a bigger role than ever. In our view, conferences should no longer be about big talks and just hearing.

By accomplishing this mission, we are making such events way more interesting for everyone. Presenters will experience a greater involvement from their audience, and the latter will not have any reasons not to actively participate on the conference. Everyone will be able to share their thoughts/concerns in the way they deem more comfortable for themselves, including anonymously.

If we had to just some values we value, those would surely be in the list:
 - Safistied users;
 - Contribution to community;
 - Product quality;
 - Simple, yet functional;
 
To make it more clear, we intend to implement a solution that is going to serve the most two important cores of any conference: speakers and audience. For more information on how both will benefit from our implementation, please refer to the user stories section.

# Requirements

This section will be used to specify the functionalities of our final product through many different ways, thus being split into the topics below.
By analyzing the problem from several perspectives, giving a special attention to the user's, we expect to build a strong outline of what our project will consist of and which problems it is going to address. 

## User Stories

Considering that we proposed to enhance the communication between speakers and audience, it only makes sense to list user stories coming from both parties.

Speakers:

"As a presenter in conferences, I would like further involvement from my audience, so as to make sure they understand each and every point of my speech."

"As a presenter in conferences, I would like further involvement from the participants, so that they could play an active role throughout the conference and help me conduct it."

"As a presenter in conferences, I want to know/answer the audience's questions in a timely way, because I feel they can be a great addition to that specific topic rather than possibly being taken as a random question in the end."

Audience:

"As a usual attender in conferences, I wish I could ask questions in an anonymous way, so that I could see them answered without being closely observed by the remaining audience during the process."

"As a participant in conferences, I want speakers to look into my questions in time, so that I can immediately make my point of view for that subject and move on to the next one, while remaining focused."

"As a participant, I want questions to be carefully selected, so that the most revelant ones are answered."

"As a participant, I would like to have an easy way to contact people who ask interesting questions and eventually schedule a meeting with them."
