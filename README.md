# Requirements

This section will be used to specify the functionalities of our final product through many different ways, thus being split into the topics below.
By analyzing the problem from several perspectives, giving a special attention to the user's, we except to build a strong outline of what our project will consist of and which problems it is going to address. 

## User Stories

Considering that we proposed to enhance the communication between speakers and audience, it only makes sense to list user stories coming from both parties.

Speakers:

"As a presenter in conferences, I would like further involvement from my audience, so as to make sure they understand each and every point of my speech."

"As a presenter in conferences, I would like appreciate involvement from the participants, so that they could play an active role throughout the conference and help me conduct it."

"As a presenter in conferences, I want to know/answer the audience's questions in a timely way, because I feel they can be a great addition to that specific topic rather than possibly being taken as a random question in the end."

Audience:

"As a usual attender in conferences, I wish to make questions in an anonymous way, so that I can see them answered without being closely observed by the remaining audience during the process."

"As a participant in conferences, I want speakers to look into my questions in time, so that I can immediatly make my point of view for that subject and move on to the next one, while remaining focused."

"As a participant, I want questions to be carefully selected, so that the most revelant ones are answered."

"As a participant, I would like to have an easy way to contact people who ask interesting questions and eventually schedule a meeting with them."
